# Enhanced SWE-Bench Submission

This repository contains an enhanced SWE-Bench submission designed to beat the top SWE-Bench Verified score by ≥2%.

## 🎯 Bounty Target

**Goal**: Beat the top SWE-Bench Verified score by ≥2% at the time of submission
**Bounty**: [AIBoards SWE-Bench Bounty](https://aiboards.io/bounties/cmfcw89ep000audgp8sfjt61q)

## 🚀 Key Features

### Advanced Algorithms
- **Self-Consistency Engine**: 7 parallel reasoning paths with 70% consensus threshold
- **Intelligent Search**: Weighted fusion with adaptive routing
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: GLM-4.5-FP8, Qwen3-Coder-480B, Kimi-K2-Instruct, DeepSeek-V3-0324

### Robust Error Handling
- **Model Fallback**: Automatic switching when APIs fail
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with health tracking
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works with or without optional dependencies

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent processing for improved speed
- **Smart Caching**: LRU eviction with TTL
- **Resource Management**: Memory/CPU monitoring and cleanup

### Comprehensive Logging
- **Trajectory Logging**: All LLM interactions and tool calls
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing, memory usage, success rates
- **Debug Information**: Detailed execution traces
