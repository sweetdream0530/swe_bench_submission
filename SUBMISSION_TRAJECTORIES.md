# SWE-Bench Submission: Enhanced Agent with Comprehensive Trajectories

## Submission Overview

This submission provides a comprehensive set of trajectories for SWE-bench evaluation, organized to meet all submission requirements for transparency and reproducibility.

## Trajectory Organization

### Structure
- **One folder per instance ID**: Each SWE-bench instance has its own dedicated folder
- **Complete model I/O**: All LLM interactions are fully logged with input/output
- **Decision tracking**: Every filtering decision and reasoning step is documented
- **Walkable paths**: Reviewers can follow the complete decision-making process

### Files per Instance
Each instance folder (`{instance_id}/`) contains:
- `trajectory.jsonl`: Complete trajectory with all model I/O and decisions
- `summary.json`: Structured summary with key metrics and results
- `README.md`: Human-readable description and usage instructions

## Trajectory Content

### What's Included
✅ **Complete LLM Input/Output**: Every model call with full context
✅ **Tool Usage**: All tool calls with parameters and results
✅ **Decision Making**: Reasoning behind each action taken
✅ **Filtering Decisions**: Why certain approaches were chosen/rejected
✅ **Performance Metrics**: Memory usage, execution time, step counts
✅ **Session Tracking**: Multiple attempts and iterations
✅ **Final Results**: Success/failure status and generated patches

### Trajectory Format
Each line in `trajectory.jsonl` represents a step:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23T18:18:34.568339",
  "step": 1,
  "action": "initialization|repository_setup|agent_preparation|llm_call|tool_call|final_result",
  "details": { /* step-specific information */ },
  "performance": { /* timing and memory metrics */ },
  "metadata": { /* instance and session tracking */ }
}
```

## Key Features

### Transparency
- **Full Model I/O**: Every LLM interaction is logged with complete context
- **Decision Rationale**: Clear reasoning for each action taken
- **Error Handling**: Failed attempts and recovery strategies documented
- **Iteration Tracking**: Multiple attempts and refinement processes

### Reproducibility
- **Complete Context**: All necessary information to understand decisions
- **Session Tracking**: Multiple execution attempts with unique session IDs
- **Performance Metrics**: Resource usage and timing information
- **Environment Details**: Repository setup and configuration

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Step-by-step Walkthrough**: Follow the complete decision path
- **LLM Call Analysis**: Examine all model interactions
- **Tool Usage Patterns**: Understand tool selection and usage
- **Success/Failure Analysis**: Compare successful vs failed approaches

## Usage Examples

### View Complete Trajectory
```bash
cd astropy__astropy-12907
cat trajectory.jsonl | jq '.'
```

### Analyze LLM Interactions
```bash
cat trajectory.jsonl | jq 'select(.action == "llm_call")'
```

### Check Tool Usage
```bash
cat trajectory.jsonl | jq 'select(.action == "tool_call")'
```

### View Final Results
```bash
cat trajectory.jsonl | jq 'select(.event == "final_result")'
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
cat summary.json | jq '.performance_summary'
```
